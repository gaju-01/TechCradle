# üöÄ Getting Started with the Application

### Steps to Start the Application

1. **Clone the repository**
   Use `git clone` to clone the repository from GitHub, which includes all the files, branches, and commits.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the SpringBoot project directory**
   From the root of the project, `cd` into the `SpringBoot` folder.
   ```bash
   cd SpringBoot
   ```

3. **Build the project**
   Use `mvn clean install` to generate the JAR file that contains all the dependencies, classes, etc.
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   Use `mvn spring-boot:run` to execute the JAR file and host the application at the default port 8080.
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

5. **Navigate to the frontend project directory**
   From the root of the project, `cd` into the `frontend` directory.
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

6. **Run the frontend application**
   Use `npm start` to run the React-based frontend project.
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project. It will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project, giving you full control over them. All commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

#### Maven Parent Overrides
Due to Maven's design, elements are inherited from the parent POM to the project POM. To prevent unwanted elements like `<license>` and `<developers>` from the parent, the project POM contains empty overrides. If you manually switch to a different parent and want the inheritance, remove those overrides.
